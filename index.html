            Putting a new spin on recycling.

            <p>
                As many as 100 million fidget spinners were sold in 2017. Most of them are destined for landfill. At FidgetCycle, we transform unwanted fidget spinners into tools and parts used in machines across the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
               You can drop off your fidget spinners at our facility, located only 2km from Dublin city centre.
